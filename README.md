# Solo project by Duncan Germain

Goal: Implement a flexible CSS grid that will maintain relative size and position while responding to browser window increases beyond 960 pixels.  This project was inspired by my introduction to the 960 grid system during Week 2 of CodeFellows in January 2015; I was deeply impressed by the concept of a grid layout, but didn't want to be constrained to a particular width.  While I never used this particular layout, the process of building it taught me a lot, and I used lessons learned from it in later projects.
